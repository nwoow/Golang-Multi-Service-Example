# Golang Multi Service Example
In this example I am creating three services which will communicate with each other more like a micro service using docker and docker compose.

In this example I am trying to create a three services based on gin gonic framework. CART PRODUCT and USER


# To run this application.

    git clone https://github.com/nwoow/Golang-Multi-Service-Example/
   
 
 And then run this command:
 
     docker-compose build
     docker-compose up -d
 
 
 You can access the service using the URL:
 
    http://localhost:9000/listuser
    http://localhost:9001/listuser
